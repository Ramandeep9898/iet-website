              Car from trash was our 2017 project in which a group of 
              engineers decided to make something good out of trash.
              We came up with the idea of making a car from trash. 
              We looked out for all possible trash that can help them 
              in building the car. After collecting the trash, the main
              task was How to build a car?. After many Brainstorming 
              sessions we decided to build the car frame from the parts 
              of an old robotics kit that was discarded in the trash and 
              developed its controller using old motors, wires and Arduino.
